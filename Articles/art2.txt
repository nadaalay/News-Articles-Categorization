Amazon may suspend its distribution activity in France after a court ruled it had to stop all
non-essential deliveries during the coronavirus pandemic.
The ruling on Tuesday followed the filing of a complaint by a French labor union which accused the online delivery
giant of endangering the lives of workers.
In a statement Wednesday, the company said it was "perplexed" by the court ruling that ordered Amazon (AMZN)
to restrict its local delivery operations to essential goods only, or face a penalty of 1 million euros ($1.1 million) for
each day it failed to comply.
"Our interpretation of the ruling suggests we might have to suspend the activities of our in-country fulfilment
network in France," an Amazon spokesperson said, "We're working rapidly to understand the judgment and
evaluate our options, and we expect to appeal."
France suspended all non-essential business last month, a
measure that is set to remain in place until May 11.
The French court on Tuesday also required that the company
carry out an assessment of the "occupational risks inherent in
the Covid-19 epidemic" in all of its warehouses.
In its statement, Amazon said it has already implemented
safety measures including "temperature checks, masks, and
enforced social distancing which have received the approval
of health and safety representatives at multiple sites."
Amazon has faced criticism in the United States over the
health and safety of workers as it faces increasing demands
on its services during the pandemic. Last week, the company
said it may begin firing employees who "intentionally violate"
its social distancing guidelines, despite complaints from
workers who say the demands of their job make it impossible
to comply with the policy.
